#Gravity Guy

A test game I'v done from scratch some months ago using HTML5 canvas.
I've left the project for 2 reasons:
	*The game idea didn't turn out the way I imagined it to be, the gameplay is too difficult
	*It was a testbed for me to apply ton of design patterns which in term slowed down the game

You can test the game here: http://venam.1.ai/gravity_guy/gravity_guy.html

Edit the `SpaceShipLevels.js` to add your own levels.
